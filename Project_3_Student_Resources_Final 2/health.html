                <h3>Emotional Health</h3>
                <p>It is natural to feel stress, anxiety, grief, and worry during and after a disaster. Everyone reacts differently, and your own feelings will change over time. Notice and accept how you feel. Taking care of your emotional health during an emergency will help you think clearly and react to the urgent needs to protect yourself and your family. Self-care during an emergency will help your long-term healing. <strong><a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/coping/selfcare.asp">More Info</a></strong></p>
